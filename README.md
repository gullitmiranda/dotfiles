## Installation

### Install dependencies

```shell
# install Xcode cli tools
xcode-select --install
# if --install don't work, reset the cli path and try again
# sudo xcode-select --reset

# install brew from https://brew.sh/
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install new terminal
brew install --cask iterm2
```

## Update system bash

On MacOS the buid-in bash is very outdated, so update and change the default bash.

```shell
brew install --bash --bash-completion
bash
# You need to start a new session to use the new bash
```

> macOS 13.5.2 (22G91) has `GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64-apple-darwin22)`
> The latest versions was `GNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (aarch64-apple-darwin22.1.0)`

### Setup dotfiles

Clone the repository

```bash
export DOTFILES_DIR=~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/gullitmiranda/dotfiles "$DOTFILES_DIR"
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR"
```

Create default synlinks:

```shell
./make_links.sh
```

### brew bundle

Bundle brew dependencies (brew, cask and mas)

```shell
# install brew core packages
brew bundle --file=Brewfile --verbose
```

> TROUBLESHOOTING: If you receive the error `Error: It seems there is already an App at ...`, manually install the package with [`--force`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/46412) and try again.

> [`mas`](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) is a Mac App Store command-line interfac

# zsh
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/zsh -o ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh

> dotfiles already load iterm2 shell integrations if the file `$HOME/.iterm2_shell_integration.$SHELL` is found

## fish

> NOTE: fish is installed on `brew bundle` command

### oh-my-fish

Install [omf](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

# Force fisher plugins install:
fisher list | fisher install
```

### Enable fish as default shell only on iTerm

To set Fish as the default shell on iTerm2, follow these steps:

1. Install Fish shell if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website or use a package manager like Homebrew.

2. Open iTerm2.

3. Go to the "iTerm2" menu and select "Preferences" or press `âŒ˜` + `,`.

4. In the Preferences window, click on the "Profiles" tab.

5. Select the profile you want to use Fish as the default shell for or create a new profile.

6. In the "Command" section, select the option "Custom Shell" and enter `/usr/local/bin/fish` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` (on MacOS M1/M2) as the command. Note that the path might be different depending on your Fish shell installation location.

7. Click "OK" to save the profile.

8. Open a new iTerm2 tab for the changes to take effect.

Now, whenever you open iTerm2 or create a new tab, Fish shell will be used as the default shell for that profile.

#### Changing the default terminal shell in vscode

## Git

### Setup Git configs

Create a local git config file from the sample. This will make sure that custom configs (probably with sensitive data) aren't commited

```shell
cp .config/git/sample.local.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```

Set your user name and email:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

How to check if all git config files are loaded

```shell
git config --get-regexp '(user|gpg|ssh|commit)'
```

### Git SSH and commit signing with 1Password

1. [Turn on the 1Password SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-3-turn-on-the-1password-ssh-agent)

    On `1Password Settings > Developer` enable the option `Use the SSH agent` and `Integrate with 1Password CLI`

2. [Configure your SSH or Git client](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-4-configure-your-ssh-or-git-client)

    ```shell
    mkdir ~/.ssh/

    cat configs/ssh-config | tee -a ~/.ssh/config
    ```

3. [Sign Git commits with SSH](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/git-commit-signing/)
    - You can get all required configs from "1Password SSH key" > "..." > "Configure Commit Signing..."
    - Save the config on `~/Code/$ORG/.gitconfig`. ex: `pbpaste > ~/Code/$ORG/.gitconfig`
    - Configure git to only use this signin config on repositories from `~/Code/$ORG`

        ```shell
        git config --global includeIf.gitdir:~/Code/$ORG/.path ~/Code/$ORG/.gitconfig
        ```

4. Check the configs:

    ```shell
    git config --get-regexp '(user|gpg|ssh|commit)'
    ```
